Object 1  constructor runs (global before main)

MAIN FUNCTION: EXECUTION BEGINS
Object 2  constructor runs (local automatic in main)
Object 3  constructor runs (local static in main)

CREATE FUNCTION: EXECUTION BEGINS
Object 5  constructor runs (local automatic in create)
Object 6  constructor runs (local static in create)
Object 7  constructor runs (local automatic in create)

CREATE FUNCTION: EXECUTION BEGINS
Object 7  destructor runs   (local automatic in create)
Object 5  destructor runs   (local automatic in create)

MAIN FUNCTION: EXECUTION RESUMES
Object 4  constructor runs (local automatic in main)

MAIN FUNCTION: EXECUTION ENDS
Object 4  destructor runs   (local automatic in main)
Object 2  destructor runs   (local automatic in main)
Object 6  destructor runs   (local static in create)
Object 3  destructor runs   (local static in main)
Object 1  destructor runs   (global before main)

Makes sense! But we have to be careful about being static, things stick around for quite a while
